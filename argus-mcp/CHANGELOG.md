# Changelog

## 1.3.0 — Living premises

The receipt's `THE UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION` line becomes a tracked object.

- **New tools:** `argus_premises` (add / amend / resolve — user-authored,
  provenance-preserving, elicitation-only resolve) and `argus_recheck`
  (mechanical numeric drift on explicit numbers, provenance-tagged `changed`
  assertions for text facts, `apply_to_matching` cross-decision fan-out).
- **Extended:** `argus_recall view="premises"` (provenance + honest staleness),
  `argus_check_in` reports due premise facts (grouped — one fact, one re-check),
  `argus_settle` takes an optional user-attributed `broken_premise_ref` and the
  track record gains a premise-attribution frequency line,
  `argus_seal` promotes a named `unverified_assumption` into the premise set
  (the set is canonical; the receipt renders its summary from the fold).
- **Return loop (passive-server honest):** every successful tool response
  carries a quiet `due_note`; new `argus://premises/due` and
  `argus://premises/{id}` resources; the `/argus-settle` ritual includes the
  re-check choreography.
- **State machine:** premises never self-create, lock at check-by
  (`PREMISE_LOCKED` — no retroactive premise-planting, no retiring the premise
  about to be proven wrong), closed decisions refuse premise events.
- **Privacy:** premise data is never part of the account-sync payload.

## 1.2.1 — Forward-compatible ledger replay

- Unknown-but-versioned ledger events (written by a newer argus-mcp) are now
  skipped silently (`integrity.skipped_unknown`) instead of being counted as
  corruption — an old install never raises a false integrity alarm on a new
  ledger. Ship this before adopting any release that writes new event types.
